title: "SOLID Principles Challenge Generator"
description: "Generates five refactor challenges, one for each SOLID principle."
instructions: |
  You are an expert in TypeScript and SOLID principles. 
  Your task is to create a challenge folder for each of the five SOLID principles 
  (Single Responsibility, Open/Close, Liskov, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion).

  For each principle, create a folder named after the principle. Inside, generate 
  the following files with appropriate TypeScript content and instructions:
  1. `<name>.solution.ts`: Contains the initial, poorly structured code and the challenge instructions.
  2. `<name>.solution.test.ts`: Contains unit tests that the refactored solution must pass.
  3. `<name>.correct.ts`: Contains the recommended, fully refactored solution.

  Use the developer extension to write all files and folders relative to the current project root.

extensions:
  - type: builtin
    name: developer
prompt: |
  Create five challenge subdirectories named 'SingleResponsibility', 'OpenClose', 
  'Liskov', 'InterfaceSegregation', and 'DependencyInversion'. 
  Inside each, generate the required three TypeScript files: solution, test, and correct. 
  Ensure the instructions in the solution files are clear, guiding the user to refactor 
  the initial code to strictly adhere to the corresponding SOLID principle.
