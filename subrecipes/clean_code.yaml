description: "Generates five refactor challenges focusing on Clean Coding best practices."
instructions: |
  You are an expert in code readability and maintainability.
  Create five distinct refactoring challenges, each covering a major Clean Code principle 
  (e.g., meaningful names, functions should do one thing, avoiding deep nesting, 
  error handling).

  For each principle, create a folder named descriptively (e.g., 'MeaningfulNames'). 
  Inside, generate the standard three challenge files: solution (with initial code/instructions), 
  test, and correct solution.

extensions:
  - type: builtin
    name: developer

  Generate five Clean Coding challenge subdirectories. For example: 'MeaningfulNames', 
  'SmallFunctions', 'AvoidComments', 'ErrorHandling', 'DecoupleDependencies'.
  In each folder, write the three required files to present a challenge that requires 
  the user to refactor the initial code according to the principle of that folder.
