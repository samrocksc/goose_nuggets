title: "Data Structures & Algorithms Challenge Generator"
description: "Generates five challenges based on classic Data Structures and Algorithms problems."
instructions: |
  You are an expert in competitive programming and algorithm efficiency.
  Create five challenges, each focused on a specific Data Structure or Algorithm 
  (e.g., Linked List, Binary Search, Graph Traversal).

  For each challenge, create a folder named descriptively (e.g., 'BinarySearch'). 
  The 'solution.ts' file should contain instructions and a function signature for the user 
  to implement. In addition to the standard three files (solution, test, correct), 
  also create a **README.md** detailing the challenge description and constraints.

  Generate five DSA challenge subdirectories. For example: 'LinkedListTraversal', 
  'BinarySearchImplementation', 'GraphDepthFirstSearch', 'MergeSortAlgorithm', 
  'TrieDataStructure'.
  In each folder, write the three required TypeScript files (solution, test, correct) 
  and a clear **README.md** that defines the challenge, input/output, and complexity constraints.
