description: "Generates five challenges based on common Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns."
instructions: |
  You are a Design Patterns expert.
  Create five challenges, each focused on implementing a specific Gang of Four (GoF) design pattern 
  (e.g., Factory, Adapter, Observer, Strategy).

  For each pattern, create a folder named after the pattern (e.g., 'FactoryPattern'). 
  The challenge in the 'solution.ts' should ask the user to implement the pattern 
  to solve a given problem using TypeScript. Generate the test and correct files as well.

extensions:
  - type: builtin

  Generate five GoF Design Pattern challenge subdirectories. For example: 'FactoryPattern', 
  'SingletonPattern', 'AdapterPattern', 'ObserverPattern', 'StrategyPattern'.
  In each folder, write the three required files. The instructions must guide the user to 
  implement the required design pattern effectively in TypeScript.
